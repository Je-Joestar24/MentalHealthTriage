feat: implement Stripe payment integration for signup flow

- Add Stripe fields to User and Organization models (customer_id, subscription_id, payment status)
- Create Stripe service for customer creation, checkout sessions, and subscription management
- Create auth service for email availability checking and temporary user creation
- Add new auth endpoints: POST /auth/check-email, POST /auth/create-temp-user, POST /auth/create-checkout-session
- Support individual ($60/month) and organization (per-seat, min 4 seats) account signups
- Handle existing unpaid users by redirecting to payment completion
- Reuse existing subscriptionEndDate field instead of creating duplicate subscription_end_at
- Auto-create Stripe customers when temporary users are created
- Enforce minimum 4 seats for organization accounts (psychologists only, admin excluded)

Backend ready for frontend integration. Webhooks not implemented per requirements.
